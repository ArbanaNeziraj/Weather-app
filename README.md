# Weather-app

This is a simple weather app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It shows the current weather for a specific city, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The app fetches real-time data from OpenWeatherMap and updates the weather icon based on the conditions. Just enter a city name to see the weather details.
